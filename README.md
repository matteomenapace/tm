* HE = Highly Exclusionary (education) 
	* universities restructured as businesses (all justified by the financial crisis)
	* creativity at the mercy of business: training *knowledge workers* and devaluing of critical thinking
	* withdrawal of state funding from undergraduate degree programmes in arts, humanities and social sciences = privatisation of English higher education
	* push for marketable skills (STEM as *national priority*).. what's the meaning of vocation?
	* **student-as-customer** model: advocated by the [2009 Browne Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/422565/bis-10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf) and implemented by the government 2010 onwards: by paying fees, students should be empowered as consumers, giving rise to better quality teaching and courses on offer reflecting <del>student</del>consumer demand
	* graduate dream of success and social mobility, which has been persistently sold to middle class youth (mass higher education): in reality, a degree is not guarantee of employment (let alone success, however you measure it) and cost of education grows faster than salaries, inflation etc
	* homogenous consumerist/pop culture

* ME (do I have a fancy acronym for it?)	
	* Independence, as in *independent learning*: students should be encouraged to take ownership of their learning paths and choose their own learning goals
	* Critical thinking: challenge industry rather than simply chasing it (or serving its employer's demands)
	* Face2face-time (aka *community of practice*): being physically in the same space, working together with co-learners and educators, and one-on-one mentoring
	* *Dream dangerously*: imagining radically different futures, rather than reskins of existing scams
	* Creativity is something everyone agrees on, but **create what**? What sort of creativity are we encouraging? What *agenda*(s) are we pursuing?
	* [ ] social responsibility..
	* Project-based, interdisciplinary curriculum
	* Open-source *courseware*: freedom to access our course material and re-use it
		* but how does this sit with the commercial nature of the institution in which this material was originally produced? with the IP that it contractually claims on it? 
		* can i keep ignoring this? 
		* can a Creative Commons licence (attribute, non-commercial) be a good compromise?
	* OPEN teaching: from lecturer to *coach*
	* **Peer-learning** (teach as soon as you learn): the best way of learning is teaching what you know to someone else

* PLAN: how am I going to put the above into practice? What am I going to experiment with?

# HE

Before I explain the ideas, methods and strategies that guide my teaching practice, let me describe the context in which I work. 

Higher Education in England can be summed up as a ***h**ighly **e**xclusionary* system.

Universities continue to be <span id="a1">restructured as private businesses</span><sup>[1](#f1)</sup> and their primary function is understood as supporting economic growth by training *knowledge workers*. 

As businesses, HE institutions become primarily concerned with *recruiting* paying customers and providing them with *marketable skills*  whilst fuelling graduate dreams of success and social mobility.

While the government withdraws state funding (especially from degree programmes in arts, humanities and social sciences) and universities increase tuition fees, for a generation adulthood starts by plunging into a **financial debt** that will dictate many of their future choices.

It is no surprise that a *value-for-money* rhetoric has become a common way of *measuring* educational *offer*. To many prospective students (and their families) the leading question becomes

> Is a degree worth the debt?





## Footnotes

<a id="f1"></a> A decades-long process which has been extensively documented, it's interesting to notice how the department responsible for  higher education policies has morphed from Department of **Education** and Science (1964), to Department for **Business**, Innovation & Skills (2009).

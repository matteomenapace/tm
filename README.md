* HE = Highly Exclusionary (education) 
	- [x] universities restructured as businesses (all justified by the financial crisis)
	- [x] creativity at the mercy of business: training *knowledge workers* and devaluing of critical thinking
	- [x] withdrawal of state funding from undergraduate degree programmes in arts, humanities and social sciences = privatisation of English higher education
	- [x] push for marketable skills (STEM as *national priority*).. what's the meaning of vocation?
	- [x] **student-as-customer** model: by paying fees, students should be empowered as consumers, giving rise to better quality teaching and courses on offer reflecting <del>student</del>consumer demand
	- [ ] graduate dream of success and social mobility, which has been persistently sold to middle class youth (mass higher education): in reality, a degree is not guarantee of employment (let alone success, however you measure it) and cost of education grows faster than salaries, inflation etc
	- [ ] consumerist culture

* ME (do I have a fancy acronym for it?)	
	* Independence, as in *independent learning*: students should be encouraged to take ownership of their learning paths and choose their own learning goals
	* Critical thinking: challenge industry rather than simply chasing it (or serving its employer's demands)
	* Face2face-time (aka *community of practice*): being physically in the same space, working together with co-learners and educators, and one-on-one mentoring
	* *Dream dangerously*: imagining radically different futures, rather than reskins of existing scams
	* Creativity is something everyone agrees on, but **create what**? What sort of creativity are we encouraging? What *agenda*(s) are we pursuing?
	* [ ] social responsibility..
	* Project-based, interdisciplinary curriculum
	* Open-source *courseware*: freedom to access our course material and re-use it
		* but how does this sit with the commercial nature of the institution in which this material was originally produced? with the IP that it contractually claims on it? 
		* can a Creative Commons licence (attribute, non-commercial) be a good compromise?
	* OPEN teaching: from lecturer to *coach*
	* **Peer-learning** (teach as soon as you learn): the best way of learning is teaching what you know to someone else

* PLAN: how am I going to put the above into practice? What am I going to experiment with?

# HE

Before I explain the ideas, methods and strategies that guide my teaching practice, let me describe the context in which I work. 

Higher Education in England can be summed up as a *<b>H</b>ighly <b>E</b>xclusionary* system.

Universities continue to be <span id="a1">restructured as private businesses</span><sup>[1](#f1)</sup>:

* their primary function is understood as supporting economic growth
* they are expected to train the *knowledge workers* the economy demands by providing them with *marketable skills*
* they are required to adopt a *student-as-customer* <span id="a2">business model</span><sup>[2](#f2)</sup>

As the government withdraws state funding<span id="a3"></span><sup>[3](#f3)</sup> and universities increase tuition fees, for a generation the *university experience* starts by plunging into a financial debt that will dictate many of their future choices.

It is no surprise that a *value-for-money* rhetoric has become a common way of framing higher education<span id="a4"></span><sup>[4](#f4)</sup>. To many prospective students (and their families) the leading question becomes

> Is a degree worth the debt?

In this scenario, where creativity is meant to be a subsidiary of *business innovation* and students are encouraged to think and act as (passive) consumers of a pricy product, what's a teacher to do? 







## Footnotes

<b id="f1">1</b> A decades-long process which has been extensively documented. It's interesting to note how the department responsible for higher education has morphed from Department of **Education** and Science (1964), to Department for **Business**, Innovation & Skills (2009). [↩](#a1)

<b id="f2">2</b> This model has been advocated by the [2009 Browne Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/422565/bis-10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf) and implemented by the government from 2010. I'm not just talking about lifting the cap on tuition fees and cutting funds to universities. Other policies are shaping the public perception of students as *consumers of education*, and enshrining that in law: for example the [Consumer Rights Bill](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2014-15/consumerrights.html) (of which I'm not discussing the merit) applies to universities and is scheduled to become law by 2015.

<b id="f3">3</b> ... especially from degree programmes in arts, humanities and social sciences whiles pushing STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) which are considered [national priority](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/maths-and-science-must-be-the-top-priority-in-our-schools-says-prime-minister).

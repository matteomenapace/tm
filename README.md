<!--<sup>Before I explain the ideas, methods and strategies that guide my teaching practice, let me describe the context in which I work.</sup> -->

A manifesto is a statement of principles and intentions, often written before putting those into practice. In this manifesto, I intend to set out a vision for the type of teaching I want to practice. It will be a constantly evolving document, as experiments will question the vision and draw its edges.



# HE

Higher Education in England can be summed up as a *<b>H</b>ighly <b>E</b>xclusionary* system.

Universities continue to be restructured as private businesses:<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

* their primary function is understood as supporting economic growth
* they are expected to train the *knowledge workers* the economy demands by providing them with *marketable skills*
* they are required to adopt a *student-as-customer* business model<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>

As the government withdraws state funding<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> and universities increase tuition fees, for the current generation the *university experience* starts by plunging into a financial debt that will dictate many of their future choices.

It is no surprise that a *value-for-money* rhetoric has become a common way of framing higher education.<sup id="a4">[4](#f4)</sup> To many prospective students (and their families) the leading question becomes

> Is a degree worth the debt?

In this scenario, where creativity is meant to be a subsidiary of *business innovation* and students are pushed to think and act as passive consumers of an exclusive product, what's an educator to do? 



# ME

If we are to borrow the student-as-customer model, then my courses would be akin to a *creative gym membership*: 

> I am your *coach*. 

> Together we will decide which *brain muscles* you want to develop, which *mental habits* you want to train, what *technical workouts* you can do. I will challenge you with creative briefs to push you out of your intellectual comfort zone. 

> To take full advantage of your membership, you will regularly work with your peers, teaching each other what you are learning. 

> Simply showing up, grazing around and bullshiting your way through the workouts is a massive waste of money.

Yet this bootcamp-style approach is not enough. I don't want students to conceive university as a (solitary) treadmill run. I want students to be *producers*,<sup id="a5">[5](#f5)</sup> or more specifically: *hackers* of their own learning and *contributors* to the production of shared knowledge.

I am using the term **hacker** because it describes a mindset rather than a job role. A hacker is intellectually curious, a critical thinker who is not afraid of subverting systems to her own needs, responding to the principles of the communities she belongs to. It also denotes an experimental approach that practices creativity as *hacking the new out of the old*.<sup id="a6">[6](#f6)</sup>

If students become hackers, then teaching and learning are **subversive activities**<sup id="a7">[7](#f7)</sup> and education is the process of questioning the dominant culture and shaping it into something fit for purpose, rather than the *re-production* of what already exists.

As a student, your learning is more effective if you teach to someone else, because teaching makes you reflect on what you know and how to communicate it. As a teacher, you are constantly learning. If we, teachers and students, are in the business of learning together, then we should practice it as **reciprocal teaching**,<sup id="a8">[8](#f8)</sup> challenging each other with questions we don't know the answers to. 
 
No matter how much tech we pump into education, the *killer-app* is still (and will be) human relationships.<sup id="a9">[9](#f9)</sup> My primary role is to facilitate **collaborative relationships** between students, and between students and practitioners. Working together in the same (real) place as part of a **community of practice**, is the actual privilege of taking a university course, and its *competitive advantage* over alternative (and hyped) solutions like MOOCs.<sup id="a10">[10](#f10)</sup>

And then there's **creativity**. This word has become an empty container for vaguely positive ideas around producing *new* meanings, perspectives, products, systems and anything in between. Who wants to be uncreative? Everyone reveres creativity, yet it is often reduced to consulting, styling, and formatting. I consider creativity as an endeavour that is neither frivolous nor politically neutral. The question is therefore

> What are you going to create and why? What is your agenda? 
 
I encourage students to take responsibility for their creations, to challenge industry practices rather than simply chasing them. In this light, technical skills are as important as **deconstruction** skills: delving under the surface of digital artefacts to understand and interrogate the cultural assumptions that produce them.

The *student-as-hacker* re-appropriates and re-mixes cultural references, designs critically and dreams dangerously.<sup id="a11">[11](#f11)</sup>

...ok, nice words but how do we do that? 



# WE 

### Co-learners

We understand and practice teaching as a *collaborative activity*, based on *mutual trust* between learners and educators rather than authority.

<!--: *reciprocal teaching* as a dialogue between teachers and students in which participants take turns assuming the role of teacher.-->

We operate as **co-learners**.

In practice:

* We don't pretend to know everything. We welcome questions we don't know the answers to (yet).   

* We propose study plans and creative briefs (not impose), discuss them with students and amend them if necessary.

* We ask students to devise their own learning goals, which we review as often as possible in person. This has proven challenging for young people that have grown up in a system where they're spoon-fed knowledge they haven't asked for, where they've rarely (or never) been asked "So, what do you want to learn?"

* We promote team work via group projects where students take turns in different roles and responsibilities.

* We provide a *scaffolding* for reciprocal teaching. Simply placing students in groups or pairs and telling them to "work together" is not going to automatically yield results. We must train students to become co-learners, drawing out the knowledge they already possess, asking open-ended questions, explaining how to provide constructive feedback. We can gradually reduce our interventions (removing the scaffolding).

* We ask students to routinely share their new skills and knowledge in class, leading mini-tutorials and moderating debates. 

* We ask students to credit their sources of inspiration and discourage secrecy (ideas are cheap anyway).

* We facilitate structured peer-assessment and demand self-assessment.

* We value formative feedback more than grades. We plan a tight *feedback loop* into our courses, as ongoing regular conversations with individual students and groups (at least 1/3 of our time should be contact time).

* We make our formal assessment process as transparent as possible: publishing assessment criteria and discussing them with students. Grading sucks but it can be useful if students know what to expect and are encouraged to exceed it.<sup id="a12">[12](#f12)</sup>

* We offer informal mentoring on student-initiated projects. Never say "This is not a uni project, and I have no time for it".

Sometimes the encouragement may take the form of a gentle push. It may feel coercive if students don't trust us, which is why it is crucial to develop trusting relationships.

Students often seek our approval (and/or the approval of their peers): we must strive not to "tell them what to do" but educate them to be open to suggestions yet firm in their decisions.


<!--
### Open teaching

The general discourse on Open Educational Resources centres around the idea of *free* (often intended as as in "free beer"). Of course kids can benefit from material that they can access freely. But that is only half of the point. 
-->

### Student-as-hacker

We move away from education as *knowledge transfer* and push towards education as *shared knowledge production*. In this system, students actively learn by *hacking* new knowledge out of the existing.

We reject the notion of creativity as politically neutral, and the subsequent role of creatives as deresponsibilised knowledge workers who mortgage their creations to the interests of others.

In practice:

* We introduce students to ideas that challenge their assumptions and ask them to produce work in reaction to these ideas.

* We constantly ask the question *why* and demand students to show evidence of their thinking.

* We stimulate debate and welcome all opinions, whilst helping students articulate their thoughts and explore different ways to express those. We don't tolerate the lack of opinions.

* We encourage students to question everything that we do and talk about. Even if it does not lead to change in the situation in question, it does lead to a development of their understanding. 

* We actively promote **experimentation**. Learning by making enables students to build technical skills and confidence, while developing their personal aesthetic. 

* We push students to observe and conceptualise their experiments. Only through reflection they can truly take ownership of their learning paths. 

* We ask students to document their creative process and research, and publish their reflections (on the Web). 

* We embrace mistakes (instead of punishing them): they are an opportunity to learn and hack something new into existence.

	> There's no win and no fail: there's only *make*<sup id="a13">[13](#f13)</sup>.

* We push students to research and re-mix cultural references, subverting their intended purpose to new meanings and agendas.

* We invite students to share their work outside the class and actively seek feedback and challenges from other communities of practice. 


### Web pedagogy

Compared to most other university subjects, *teaching the Web* can feel like chasing an elusive and ever-changing animal in a vastly unexplored field. 

This means we have more room to experiment, less (or no) traditions to confront, more opportunities to discover something new. At the same time, this discovery process may be challenging and even painful at times.

As with many media that were "new", we may be tempted to apply old metaphors to the Web. As well as adopting new *social protocols* without questioning them (`might makes right?`). 

As old business models are merged with new technologies (see Amazon<sup id="a11">[11](#f11)</sup>) and online corporations colonise (privatise, fence off) even more spaces on the Web, we resist the status quo by encouraging students to think critically about their daily habits mediated by technologies. That's a starting point, however we can push students to "dream dangerously" and envision radically different uses for technology.

As a "new" medium, it should be easier to teach the Web as a *subversive* activity (intended as process of questioning the dominant culture and shape it into something fit for purpose) rather than a *reproduction* of existing cultural models. Asking questions that we don't already know the answer to.


`Open by design...`

In practice:

* **Web literacy**: it's not just about code. Learning how to (re)search and evaluate information, how to contribute to open knowledge, how to communicate..

* Computing is not just a science, it's a way of solving problems. Computational thinking is about people first.

* We encourage students to print out their code and visualise their understanding. Digital tech is not the solution to everything. Even if we're designing or developing digital artefacts, pen and paper are still (and will be) effective "thinking tools". 

* question *artificial scarcity* et al

### The commons

What we do is not just for an elite of students who can afford the extortionate cost of a university degree. Outreach projects are often perceived as a sort of *moral debt repayment* (or maybe it's my Catholic upbringing). It's actually in our interest to engage with the communities that orbit around our university. And not just the obvious ones (creative industries etc), but rather those who are geographically close but excluded from our daily *filter bubbles*<sup id="a9">[9](#f9)</sup>.

In practice:

* working with local schools, where our students take on a facilitator role and share their knowledge with pupils from culturally diverse backgrounds
* pushing students beyond their comfort zones, to approach and interview strangers for their design research 
* creating and publishing *how-to* tutorials 
* contributing to open-source projects
* encouraging students to volunteer (see CodeClub) and attend professional or vocational meetups
* publishing our *courseware* with copy-left licences that allow the to be repurposed (in spite of restrictive IP enforcements)
* open-source curriculum



























## Footnotes

<b id="f1">1</b> A decades-long process which has been extensively documented. It's interesting to note how the department responsible for higher education has morphed from Department of **Education** and Science (1964), to Department for **Business**, Innovation & Skills (2009). [↩](#a1)

<b id="f2">2</b> This model has been advocated by the [2009 Browne Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/422565/bis-10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf) and implemented by the government from 2010. I'm not just talking about lifting the cap on tuition fees and cutting funds to universities. Other policies are shaping the public perception of students as *consumers of education*, and enshrining that in law: for example the [Consumer Rights Bill](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2014-15/consumerrights.html) (of which I'm not discussing the merit) applies to universities and is scheduled to become law by 2015. [↩](#a2)

<b id="f3">3</b> ... especially from degree programmes in arts, humanities and social sciences whiles pushing STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) which are considered [national priority](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/maths-and-science-must-be-the-top-priority-in-our-schools-says-prime-minister). [↩](#a3)

<b id="f4">4</b> What happens if we truly frame students as paying customers? 

Let's imagine. (I'm making this thought experiment because it starts to become hard to envision a different model.)

* As a customer, a university student purchases a *subscription* to a 2-4 years (typically 3) *educational product* (the "course").
	* The subscription has to be renewed annually. 
	* The product includes a membership to the university, access to its facilities and resources, group training sessions, one-to-one consultancy and assessment (verbal and written) of the student's output.
	* For the duration of the course, a student is deemed to be *engaged* with her course: attending as required, responding in a timely manner to the needs of the programme and progressing adequately. 
* At the end of the course, the customer will be accredited by the university a certificate of attendance and achievement (the "degree certificate"). 
	* A degree certificate is no guarantee of future employment, however it is differently valued by customers, their families and potential employers.
	* Degree certificates are only accredited upon completion of the 3 years contract. A customer cannot claim a half-completed degree, for instance. 
	* Students in debt to the university will not be permitted to "graduate" (obtain the degree certificate).
	* The closer customers are to the end of the course and subsequent degree accreditation, the less likely they will be to stop their yearly subscription (regardless of overall satisfaction).
* As a customer, a student needs money. 
	* Given that (most of) her time is contractually devoted to the university subscription, her spending must be *on credit*. This is usually provided by bank loans specifically designed for students: easy credit (or, from the other perspective, debt accumulation) for the duration of the university subscription, which must be repaid after the contract ends, regardless of the acquisition of a degree certificate.
	* As a customer, a student uses private loans to advance and sustain the costs of their years at university, effectively turning their subscription into a financial investment. 
* As a customer, a prospective student will consider the risks of subscribing to degrees that may not *pay off in the future*. By this she means that certain unpractical degrees may not allow them to land jobs that enable their future selves to repay the loans.
* As a customer, a student (and her family) may consider her university subscription as a status symbol: *I go to university because I can afford it*.
* As a paying customer, a student could demand her money back in case she's not satisfied with the education she purchased. 
* As a customer, a student would logically want to select the courses and teachers she's going to be taught, rather than be given a "package". Perhaps the best teachers should also be more expensive.
* As a customer, a struggling student is a business problem
* As a business that depends on paying customers, a university is primarily concerned with *recruiting* them. The *point of sale* is crucial. 
* As a business, a university must grow (or at least maintain) its revenue. The largest income for universities is currently tuition fees paid by students. 

Can you spot the differences between this and the current HE model? [↩](#a4)

<b id="f5">5</b> The [Student as Producer](http://edeu.lincoln.ac.uk/student-as-producer/) framework, developed by the University of Lincoln, focuses on *research-engaged teaching and learning*, which is defined as

> A fundamental principle of curriculum design whereby students learn primarily by engagement in real research projects, or projects which replicate the process of research in their discipline. Engagement is created through active collaboration amongst and between students and academics.

*Student as Producer* is based on a number of intellectual projects, including Walter Benjamin's *Author as Producer* (1934). 

When Benjamin called for authors to become producers, he did not mean for them to become factory workers alienated from the form and purpose of the manufactured thing. Our challenge as educators today is to help students become the hackers, not the mere consumers, of technology. [↩](#a5) 

<b id="f6">6</b> I'm standing on McKenzie Wark's shoulders here. In [A Hacker Manifesto](http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors0/warktext.html) he states

> Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colourings, we create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things. [↩](#a6)

<b id="f7">7</b> In [Teaching as a Subversive Activity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79681.Teaching_as_a_Subversive_Activity) Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner argue that, rather than preparing people to live in society as it is, an *inquiry-based education* should encourage young people to interrogate the status quo, to generate new thinking and to move society forward. [↩](#a7)

<b id="f8">8</b> [Visible Learning](http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/hattie-ranking-teaching-effects/) is a comprehensive review of educational research, in which John Hattie ranked many teaching approaches and various other factors that can have an impact on learning. *Reciprocal teaching* ranks as the third most effective teaching approach.

Numbers aside, I am using [Palincsar's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_teaching#cite_note-2) of reciprocal teaching as

> a dialogue between teachers and students in which participants take turns assuming the role of teacher 

My hypothesis is that reciprocal teaching is not just an effective approach to develop reading skills, but an essential ingredient for any collaborative teaching strategy.  [↩](#a8)

<b id="f9">9</b> I heard this from [Simon Breakspear](https://twitter.com/simonbreakspear) and in its vagueness it stroke a chord with me. It's a similar statement (a remix perhaps?) to David Preston's 
> Devices will never replace or even compete with the learning benefits of human interaction. [↩](#a9)

<b id="f10">10</b> Massive Open Online Courses [↩](#a10)

<b id="f11">11</b> ... as popularised by [Slavoj Žižek](http://www.versobooks.com/books/1161-the-year-of-dreaming-dangerously). I understand ideology in the way that Žižek describes it as "the frame within which our world is produced, but we are not aware of it". He also argues that in our so-called *post-ideological* age we are aware of this overarching frame but we don't really care. 

As educators today we should encourage students to care, constantly deconstructing ideologies and designing alternatives to the mainstream. [↩](#a11)

<b id="f12">12</b> John Hattie demonstrated how students are very accurate at predicting how they will perform in tests. So what's the point of tests and grading? Hattie argues educators must help students *exceed* their expectations, rather than formally acknowledging them. [↩](#a12)

* HE = Highly Exclusionary (education) 
	- [x] universities restructured as businesses (all justified by the financial crisis)
	- [x] creativity at the mercy of business: training *knowledge workers* and devaluing of critical thinking
	- [x] withdrawal of state funding from undergraduate degree programmes in arts, humanities and social sciences = privatisation of English higher education
	- [x] push for marketable skills (STEM as *national priority*).. what's the meaning of vocation?
	- [x] **student-as-customer** model: by paying fees, students should be empowered as consumers, giving rise to better quality teaching and courses on offer reflecting <del>student</del>consumer demand
	- [ ] graduate dream of success and social mobility, which has been persistently sold to middle class youth (mass higher education): in reality, a degree is not guarantee of employment (let alone success, however you measure it) and cost of education grows faster than salaries, inflation etc
	- [ ] consumerist culture: a larger cultural shift that universities have little to do with, and is similarly experienced in healthcare and other fields that historically were more insulated from market language and orientation

* ME (do I have a fancy acronym for it?)	
	* Independence, as in *independent learning*: students should be encouraged to take ownership of their learning paths and choose their own learning goals
	* Critical thinking: challenge industry rather than simply chasing it (or serving its employer's demands)
	* Face2face-time (aka *community of practice*): being physically in the same space, working together with co-learners and educators, and one-on-one mentoring
	* *Dream dangerously*: imagining radically different futures, rather than reskins of existing scams
	* Creativity is something everyone agrees on, but **create what**? What sort of creativity are we encouraging? What *agenda*(s) are we pursuing?
	* [ ] social responsibility..
	* Project-based, interdisciplinary curriculum
	* Open-source *courseware*: freedom to access our course material and re-use it
		* but how does this sit with the commercial nature of the institution in which this material was originally produced? with the IP that it contractually claims on it? 
		* can a Creative Commons licence (attribute, non-commercial) be a good compromise?
	* OPEN teaching: from lecturer to *coach*
	* **Peer-learning** (teach as soon as you learn): the best way of learning is teaching what you know to someone else

* PLAN: how am I going to put the above into practice? What am I going to experiment with?

# HE

Before I explain the ideas, methods and strategies that guide my teaching practice, let me describe the context in which I work. 

Higher Education in England can be summed up as a *<b>H</b>ighly <b>E</b>xclusionary* system.

Universities continue to be restructured as private businesses<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>:

* their primary function is understood as supporting economic growth
* they are expected to train the *knowledge workers* the economy demands by providing them with *marketable skills*
* they are required to adopt a *student-as-customer* business model<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>

As the government withdraws state funding<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> and universities increase tuition fees, for a generation the *university experience* starts by plunging into a financial debt that will dictate many of their future choices.

It is no surprise that a *value-for-money* rhetoric has become a common way of framing higher education<sup id="a4">[4](#f4)</sup>. To many prospective students (and their families) the leading question becomes

> Is a degree worth the debt?

In this scenario, where creativity is meant to be a subsidiary of *business innovation* and students are encouraged to think and act as (passive) consumers of a pricy product, what's a teacher to do? 







## Footnotes

<b id="f1">1</b> A decades-long process which has been extensively documented. It's interesting to note how the department responsible for higher education has morphed from Department of **Education** and Science (1964), to Department for **Business**, Innovation & Skills (2009). [↩](#a1)

<b id="f2">2</b> This model has been advocated by the [2009 Browne Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/422565/bis-10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf) and implemented by the government from 2010. I'm not just talking about lifting the cap on tuition fees and cutting funds to universities. Other policies are shaping the public perception of students as *consumers of education*, and enshrining that in law: for example the [Consumer Rights Bill](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2014-15/consumerrights.html) (of which I'm not discussing the merit) applies to universities and is scheduled to become law by 2015. [↩](#a2)

<b id="f3">3</b> ... especially from degree programmes in arts, humanities and social sciences whiles pushing STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) which are considered [national priority](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/maths-and-science-must-be-the-top-priority-in-our-schools-says-prime-minister). [↩](#a3)

<b id="f4">4</b> What happens if we truly frame students as paying customers? 

Let's imagine. (I'm making this thought experiment because it starts to become hard to envision a different model.)

* As a customer, a university student purchases a *subscription* to a 2-4 years (typically 3) *educational product* (the "course").
	* The subscription has to be renewed annually. 
	* The product includes a membership to the university, access to its facilities and resources, group training sessions, one-to-one consultancy and assessment (verbal and written) of the student's output.
	* For the duration of the course, a student is deemed to be *engaged* with her course: attending as required, responding in a timely manner to the needs of the programme and progressing adequately. 
* At the end of the course, the customer will be accredited by the university a certificate of attendance and achievement (the "degree certificate"). 
	* A degree certificate is no guarantee of future employment, however it is differently valued by customers, their families and potential employers.
	* Degree certificates are only accredited upon completion of the 3 years contract. A customer cannot claim a half-completed degree, for instance. 
	* Students in debt to the university will not be permitted to "graduate" (obtain the degree certificate).
	* The closer customers are to the end of the course and subsequent degree accreditation, the less likely they will be to stop their yearly subscription (regardless of overall satisfaction).
* As a customer, a student needs money. 
	* Given that (most of) her time is contractually devoted to the university subscription, her spending must be *on credit*. This is usually provided by bank loans specifically designed for students: easy credit (or, from the other perspective, debt accumulation) for the duration of the university subscription, which must be repaid after the contract ends, regardless of the acquisition of a degree certificate.
	* As a customer, a student uses private loans to advance and sustain the costs of their years at university, effectively turning their subscription into a financial investment. 
* As a customer, a prospective student will consider the risks of subscribing to degrees that may not *pay off in the future*. By this she means that certain unpractical degrees may not allow them to land jobs that enable their future selves to repay the loans.
* As a customer, a student (and her family) may consider her university subscription as a status symbol: *I go to university because I can afford it*.
* As a paying customer, a student could demand her money back in case she's not satisfied with the education she purchased. 
* As a customer, a student would logically want to select the courses and teachers she's going to be taught, rather than be given a "package". Perhaps the best teachers should also be more expensive.
* As a customer, a struggling student is a business problem
* As a business that depends on paying customers, a university is primarily concerned with *recruiting* them. The *point of sale* is crucial. 
* As a business, a university must grow (or at least maintain) its revenue. The largest income for universities is currently tuition fees paid by students. 

Can you spot the differences between this and the current HE model? [↩](#a4)

* HE = Highly Extortionate (Exclusionary) (education) 
	* graduate dream of success and social mobility, which has been persistently sold to middle class youth (mass higher education): in reality, a degree is not guarantee of employment (let alone success, however you measure it) and cost of education grows faster than salaries, inflation etc
	* **student-as-customer** model: advocated by the [2009 Browne Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/422565/bis-10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf) and implemented by the government 2010 onwards: by paying fees, students should be empowered as consumers, giving rise to better quality teaching and courses on offer reflecting <del>student</del>consumer demand.
	* universities restructured as businesses (all justified by the financial crisis)
	* withdrawal of state funding from undergraduate degree programmes in arts, humanities and social sciences = privatisation of English higher education
	* push for marketable skills (STEM as *national priority*).. what's the meaning of vocation?
	* creativity at the mercy of business: training *knowledge workers* and devaluing of critical thinking
	* homogenous consumerist/pop culture

* MY APPROACH (do I have a fancy acronym for it?)	
	* Independence, as in *independent learning*: students should be encouraged to take ownership of their learning paths and choose their own learning goals
	* Critical thinking: challenge industry rather than simply chasing it (or serving its employer's demands)
	* Face2face-time (aka *community of practice*): being physically in the same space, working together with co-learners and educators, and one-on-one mentoring
	* *Dream dangerously*: imagining radically different futures, rather than reskins of existing scams
	* Creativity is something everyone agrees on, but **create what**? What sort of creativity are we encouraging? What *agenda*(s) are we pursuing?
	* [ ] social responsibility..
	* Project-based, interdisciplinary curriculum
	* Open-source *courseware*: freedom to access our course material and re-use it
		* but how does this sit with the commercial nature of the institution in which this material was originally produced? with the IP that it contractually claims on it? 
		* can i keep ignoring this? 
		* can a Creative Commons licence (attribute, non-commercial) be a good compromise?
	* OPEN teaching: from lecturer to *coach*
	* **Peer-learning** (teach as soon as you learn): the best way of learning is teaching what you know to someone else

* PLAN: how am I going to put the above into practice? What am I going to experiment with?

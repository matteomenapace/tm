<!--<sup>Before I explain the ideas, methods and strategies that guide my teaching practice, let me describe the context in which I work.</sup> -->
	
# HE

Higher Education in England can be summed up as a *<b>H</b>ighly <b>E</b>xclusionary* system.

Universities continue to be restructured as private businesses<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>:

* their primary function is understood as supporting economic growth
* they are expected to train the *knowledge workers* the economy demands by providing them with *marketable skills*
* they are required to adopt a *student-as-customer* business model<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>

As the government withdraws state funding<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> and universities increase tuition fees, for a generation the *university experience* starts by plunging into a financial debt that will dictate many of their future choices.

It is no surprise that a *value-for-money* rhetoric has become a common way of framing higher education<sup id="a4">[4](#f4)</sup>. To many prospective students (and their families) the leading question becomes

> Is a degree worth the debt?

In this scenario, where creativity is meant to be a subsidiary of *business innovation* and students are pushed to think and act as passive consumers of an exclusive product, what's a teacher to do? 


# ME

If we are to borrow the student-as-customer model, then I want my courses to be like a *creative gym membership*: 

> I am your **coach**. 

> Together we will discuss which brain muscles you want to develop, which habits you want to lose, what workouts you can do. I'll challenge you with creative briefs to push you out of your intellectual comfort zone. 

> To take full advantage of your membership, you'll be working with your peers and me, teaching each other what you've learned. 

> Show up and say "hi" to everyone at the gym, glance at the equipment and b.s. your way through the workouts and that colossal waste of money and resources is on you.

In real gyms members can hire a personal coach (or an app) and train independently. Or just exercise on the treadmill earplugged. How do we prevent students from mistaking "independence" for "selfishness"?

Working together in the same (real) place, a **community of practice** engaged in face-2-face conversations and collaborations is the actual privilege of taking a degree course, and its *competitive advantage* over alternative (and popular/hyped) solutions like MOOCs<sup id="a7">[7](#f7)</sup>. 

No matter how much tech we pump into education, the *killer-app* is still (and will be) human relationships<sup id="a5">[5](#f5)</sup>. I see my role as primarily to foster **collaborative relationships** between students, and between students and practitioners. 

I learned that the best way to learn something is teaching it to someone else, as soon as you learned it. **Peer learning** has proven to be effective, not just in learning skills, facts and figures, but more importantly in putting students at the heart of a system<sup id="a6">[6](#f6)</sup> where they are active makers of their learning experiences. It is not a new idea (and not a single method), yet it still encounters resistance. Mainly because it's hard to let go of "lecture control" and allow students to take charge. Pushing past the initial inertia is key. And perhaps overcoming the "I know better" attitude to acknowledge that we can all learn from each other.

`TODO bridge between peer learning and creativity?`

**Creativity** is a concept everyone agrees on. Who wants to be uncreative? I consider creativity as an endeavour that is neither frivolous nor politically neutral. So the questions is

> What are you going to create and why? What is your agenda? 

I encourage students to take responsibility for their creations, to challenge industry practices rather than simply chasing them. In this light, technical skills are as important as **deconstruction** skills: scratching under the surface of digital artefacts to understand their ideologies,  questioning the dominant frames, designing critically, re-appropriating and re-mixing cultural references, dreaming dangerously<sup id="a8">[8](#f8)</sup>.  



...ok, nice words but how do we do that? 

# WE 

### Co-learners

We understand and practice teaching as a collaborative activity.

We acknowledge the hierarchical lecturer-student relationship yet operate as **co-learners**.

In practice:

* we propose work plans (not impose), discuss them with students and amend them if necessary
* we ask students to devise their own learning goals, which we review as often as possible in person. This has proven challenging for young people that have grown up in a system where they're spoon-fed knowledge they haven't asked for, where they've rarely (or never) been asked "So, what do you want to learn?"
* we offer informal mentoring on student-initiated projects 
* we strive to make our assessment process as transparent as possible: publishing assessment criteria, discussing them with students and encouraging self-assessment
* we ask students to routinely share their new skills in class, leading mini-tutorials. It may sound obvious once you think that the main business of a university is learning that collaboration means *Reciprocal Teaching*
* we promote team work via group projects where students take turns in different roles and responsibilities

```

Importance of trust and commitment
```

<!--Education is not a commodity you can buy. But you can own your learning path. I encourage students to develop and actively pursue their learning goals (rather than expect the university to spoon-feed them with knowledge and skills) and share their journey with their peers (and the commons).-->


### Open teaching

The general discourse on Open Educational Resources centres around the idea of *free* (often intended as as in "free beer"). Of course kids can benefit from material that they can access freely. But that is only half of the point. The other half is that kids can *contribute* to the shared knowledge. Moving away from *knowledge transfer* to pursue *knowledge production*.

This requires a change in the way we teach.

* don't pretend you know everything, but be open about what you don't know. A teacher is a guide, able to point learners in different directions and refocus their attention. 
	<!--We can't learn on their behalf.-->
* nurture trust: if students don't trust us they won't follow us
* Encourage students to share and contribute rather than keeping their ideas secret
* Credit where it's due. Nothing is original, everything is a remix.
* minimise "disposable" assignments, those who have no relevance to a student's work and are painful to grade. *Relevance* is something to be negotiated, not imposed
* provide a detailed description of how the assignment will be graded
* feedback is more important than grades (which are sometimes inflated)
 
    
* tight verbal feedback loop, aka *Face2FaceTime* (thanks Apple)
* open-source curriculum




Student often seek our approval (and/or the approval of their peers): we must strive not to "tell them what to do" but educate them to be open to suggestions yet firm in their decisions.

### Experiment

Embrace mistakes (instead of punishing them): they are an opportunity to learn and hack something new into existence.

> There's no win and no fail: there's only *make*<sup id="a10">[10](#f10)</sup>.




### Web pedagogy

Compared to most other university subjects, *teaching the Web* can feel like chasing an elusive and ever-changing animal in a vastly unexplored field. 

This means we have more room to experiment, less (or no) traditions to confront, more opportunities to discover something new. At the same time, this discovery process may be challenging and even painful at times.

As with many media that were "new", we may be tempted to apply old metaphors to the Web. As well as adopting new *social protocols* without questioning them (`might makes right?`). 

As old business models are merged with new technologies (see Amazon<sup id="a11">[11](#f11)</sup>) and online corporations colonise (privatise, fence off) even more spaces on the Web, we resist the status quo by encouraging students to think critically about their daily habits mediated by technologies. That's a starting point, however we can push students to "dream dangerously" and envision radically different uses for technology.


`Open by design...`



In practice:

* **Web literacy**: it's not just about code. Learning how to (re)search and evaluate information, how to contribute to open knowledge, how to communicate..

* Computing is not just a science, it's a way of solving problems. Computational thinking is about people first.

* We encourage students to print out their code and visualise their understanding. Digital tech is not the solution to everything. Even if we're designing or developing digital artefacts, pen and paper are still (and will be) effective "thinking tools". 

* question *artificial scarcity* et al

### The commons

What we do is not just for an elite of students who can afford the extortionate cost of a university degree. Outreach projects are often perceived as a sort of *moral debt repayment* (or maybe it's my Catholic upbringing). It's actually in our interest to engage with the communities that orbit around our university. And not just the obvious ones (creative industries etc), but rather those who are geographically close but excluded from our daily *filter bubbles*<sup id="a9">[9](#f9)</sup>.

In practice:

* working with local schools, where our students take on a facilitator role and share their knowledge with pupils from culturally diverse backgrounds
* pushing students beyond their comfort zones, to approach and interview strangers for their design research 
* creating and publishing *how-to* tutorials 
* contributing to open-source projects
* encouraging students to volunteer (see CodeClub) and attend professional or vocational meetups
* publishing our *courseware* with copy-left licences that allow the to be repurposed (in spite of restrictive IP enforcements)

Sometimes the encouragement may take the form of a gentle push. It may feel coercive if students don't trust us, which is why it's crucial to develop trusting relationships





## Footnotes

<b id="f1">1</b> A decades-long process which has been extensively documented. It's interesting to note how the department responsible for higher education has morphed from Department of **Education** and Science (1964), to Department for **Business**, Innovation & Skills (2009). [↩](#a1)

<b id="f2">2</b> This model has been advocated by the [2009 Browne Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/422565/bis-10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report.pdf) and implemented by the government from 2010. I'm not just talking about lifting the cap on tuition fees and cutting funds to universities. Other policies are shaping the public perception of students as *consumers of education*, and enshrining that in law: for example the [Consumer Rights Bill](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2014-15/consumerrights.html) (of which I'm not discussing the merit) applies to universities and is scheduled to become law by 2015. [↩](#a2)

<b id="f3">3</b> ... especially from degree programmes in arts, humanities and social sciences whiles pushing STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) which are considered [national priority](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/maths-and-science-must-be-the-top-priority-in-our-schools-says-prime-minister). [↩](#a3)

<b id="f4">4</b> What happens if we truly frame students as paying customers? 

Let's imagine. (I'm making this thought experiment because it starts to become hard to envision a different model.)

* As a customer, a university student purchases a *subscription* to a 2-4 years (typically 3) *educational product* (the "course").
	* The subscription has to be renewed annually. 
	* The product includes a membership to the university, access to its facilities and resources, group training sessions, one-to-one consultancy and assessment (verbal and written) of the student's output.
	* For the duration of the course, a student is deemed to be *engaged* with her course: attending as required, responding in a timely manner to the needs of the programme and progressing adequately. 
* At the end of the course, the customer will be accredited by the university a certificate of attendance and achievement (the "degree certificate"). 
	* A degree certificate is no guarantee of future employment, however it is differently valued by customers, their families and potential employers.
	* Degree certificates are only accredited upon completion of the 3 years contract. A customer cannot claim a half-completed degree, for instance. 
	* Students in debt to the university will not be permitted to "graduate" (obtain the degree certificate).
	* The closer customers are to the end of the course and subsequent degree accreditation, the less likely they will be to stop their yearly subscription (regardless of overall satisfaction).
* As a customer, a student needs money. 
	* Given that (most of) her time is contractually devoted to the university subscription, her spending must be *on credit*. This is usually provided by bank loans specifically designed for students: easy credit (or, from the other perspective, debt accumulation) for the duration of the university subscription, which must be repaid after the contract ends, regardless of the acquisition of a degree certificate.
	* As a customer, a student uses private loans to advance and sustain the costs of their years at university, effectively turning their subscription into a financial investment. 
* As a customer, a prospective student will consider the risks of subscribing to degrees that may not *pay off in the future*. By this she means that certain unpractical degrees may not allow them to land jobs that enable their future selves to repay the loans.
* As a customer, a student (and her family) may consider her university subscription as a status symbol: *I go to university because I can afford it*.
* As a paying customer, a student could demand her money back in case she's not satisfied with the education she purchased. 
* As a customer, a student would logically want to select the courses and teachers she's going to be taught, rather than be given a "package". Perhaps the best teachers should also be more expensive.
* As a customer, a struggling student is a business problem
* As a business that depends on paying customers, a university is primarily concerned with *recruiting* them. The *point of sale* is crucial. 
* As a business, a university must grow (or at least maintain) its revenue. The largest income for universities is currently tuition fees paid by students. 

Can you spot the differences between this and the current HE model? [↩](#a4)

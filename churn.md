Imagine for a minute you're an alien who just landed in the UK and wish to find out how human beings learn the most complex skills. 


My problem with this way of seeing education as a product, is that it reduces learning to a commodity. It also devalues the role of collaboration, reframing the student - teacher relationship as customer - shop assistant.


Why exactly do people (still) go to university, if it's such a risky choice?

This question is particularly relevant for **design universities**, which don't offer the legal weight of other degree certificates (compare that with a medicine degree, for instance). 

How effective is it to spread your learning over such a long period, often with little "real-world" feedback and at a de-facto part-time pace (many students work shifts to pay their fees)? Can you learn the same skills by taking a bootcamp, making work experience and/or following online courses (MOOCs)? 


With a general push towards STEM subjects, what's the role of a design course?


Many universities may appear as conservative institutions resting on historical laurels, [reluctant to innovate](http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/why_universities_dont_just_need_more_innovation_0.pdf) and struggling to keep the pace of the industries which they supposedly serve as educational gatekeepers. 


So what's the role of a university teacher in this scenario?


Whilst in an ideal world merit (intelligence, academic achievement etc.) may be the criteria to define who gets into higher education, increasingly the deciding factor is money. 









If you look at the figures, **higher education** is an expensive long-term investment. 

Who can afford and is willing to spend ten grand a year over three or more years to obtain a degree certificate that is not guarantee of employment?

- [x] [The Academic Manifesto: From an Occupied to a Public University](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9270-9/fulltext.html): a case study on Dutch universities but largely applicable to the UK HE
	> The regime does not really care about high-quality results, which it cannot judge, but rather about performance: the tactically well thought-out and cleverly buffed-up illusion of excellence. 
	
	> instrumental skills aimed at specific labour markets
	
	> By cooperating with business, [universities managements] expect universities will transform their wonderful discoveries into marketable products within a few years. This promise not only exhibits a naive belief in commodified universities delivering immediate economic relief, but also a shocking reduction of social benefit to economic gain.
	 
	>  No more science shops, no public university, no university as a platform for uplifting the people, but instead privatised knowledge embedded in expensive patents, published in unaffordable and exclusively English-language academic journals aimed at international colleagues and businesses.
	
	> So, there we are: cowards, beggars, petty thieves and collaborators. Together, we face the Wolf alone.
	
	> [As universities] we are not the start of a production line of a profitable gadget factory, but a knowledge commons: a shared, organically growing garden of know-how and wisdom from which everybody may learn according to their needs, and to which everybody may contribute. Our task is to share the produce of this garden and to cultivate it with as many people as possible, not to cultivate standardised minds at the lowest possible cost. 
	
	> We will tell students that they study to become good scholars and responsible members of society, not for the sake of a highly-paid job at the end of the diploma ceremony. We will once again tell them that they are primarily learners and citizens, not consumers.
	 
	 
- [x] [The National Student Survey should be abolished before it does any more harm](http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/aug/13/the-national-student-survey-should-be-abolished-before-it-does-any-more-harm)
	> ... a survey that tells us that the overwhelming majority (86%) of students at all universities are satisfied, and that there is little difference between institutions, actually tells us very little indeed.
	
	> Just as high IQ scores tell us more about a person’s ability to pass IQ tests than they do about their intelligence, so the high NSS results tell us more about the sector’s ability to perform well in **satisfaction surveys** than the quality of what happens within universities.  
	
	> If university does not leave students at least a little dissatisfied, it means they haven’t been sufficiently challenged or *pushed outside of their intellectual comfort zone* – and they should ask for their money back.
	
	> In certain respects, the NSS is not unlike TripAdvisor, except that TripAdvisor does at least allow the possibility of a response from the reviewee (comment)

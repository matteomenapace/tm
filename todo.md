- [x] [The Academic Manifesto: From an Occupied to a Public University](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-015-9270-9/fulltext.html): a case study on Dutch universities but largely applicable to the UK HE
	> The regime does not really care about high-quality results, which it cannot judge, but rather about performance: the tactically well thought-out and cleverly buffed-up illusion of excellence. 
	
	> instrumental skills aimed at specific labour markets
	
	> By cooperating with business, [universities managements] expect universities will transform their wonderful discoveries into marketable products within a few years. This promise not only exhibits a naive belief in commodified universities delivering immediate economic relief, but also a shocking reduction of social benefit to economic gain.
	 
	>  No more science shops, no public university, no university as a platform for uplifting the people, but instead privatised knowledge embedded in expensive patents, published in unaffordable and exclusively English-language academic journals aimed at international colleagues and businesses.
	
	> So, there we are: cowards, beggars, petty thieves and collaborators. Together, we face the Wolf alone.
	
	> [As universities] we are not the start of a production line of a profitable gadget factory, but a knowledge commons: a shared, organically growing garden of know-how and wisdom from which everybody may learn according to their needs, and to which everybody may contribute. Our task is to share the produce of this garden and to cultivate it with as many people as possible, not to cultivate standardised minds at the lowest possible cost. 
	
	> We will tell students that they study to become good scholars and responsible members of society, not for the sake of a highly-paid job at the end of the diploma ceremony. We will once again tell them that they are primarily learners and citizens, not consumers.
	 
	 
- [x] [The National Student Survey should be abolished before it does any more harm](http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/aug/13/the-national-student-survey-should-be-abolished-before-it-does-any-more-harm)
	> ... a survey that tells us that the overwhelming majority (86%) of students at all universities are satisfied, and that there is little difference between institutions, actually tells us very little indeed.
	
	> Just as high IQ scores tell us more about a person’s ability to pass IQ tests than they do about their intelligence, so the high NSS results tell us more about the sector’s ability to perform well in **satisfaction surveys** than the quality of what happens within universities.  
	
	> If university does not leave students at least a little dissatisfied, it means they haven’t been sufficiently challenged or *pushed outside of their intellectual comfort zone* – and they should ask for their money back.
	
	> In certain respects, the NSS is not unlike TripAdvisor, except that TripAdvisor does at least allow the possibility of a response from the reviewee (comment)


- [ ] [Customer Mentality](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2014/02/27/essay-critiques-how-student-customer-idea-erodes-key-values-higher-education) 

	> The student-as-customer model allows us to rationalize (actually, rationalizes for us) the cycles of student-loan debt that increasingly appear to mortgage many young graduates’ futures. Such logic also allows us to write off as unwise those students who accumulate large debts on seemingly “impractical” degrees, without acknowledging the larger cycle of recruitment and easy-credit through which such students are convinced to buy into, literally, their university in the first place.
	
	> The burden of debt has been shifted onto students.
	
	> In the student-as-customer model, students and their parents both begin to ask a “what am I buying?” question. [...] Students, and those who “assess university success,” become fixated on their perception of the end product, a student seated in an office chair, and forget that education is a process, and one that students ought to continue on their own post-graduation. 
	
	> The problem is not even necessarily in having a student-as-customer model, but in assuming that growth, rather than sustainability and equilibrium, is the only forward motion available to higher education.
	
	> The university itself becomes the product, rather than the education that the university provides.
	
	> The mentality treats academic coursework as parts within a Fordian, standardized academic assembly line. 
	
	> If there’s an upside to thinking of students as customers, I think it is that the model reminds us that we and our universities are directly accountable to students.
	
	> I view my students, not as my customers, but as my product. I am using the raw material that comes in the door to produce mature, intelligent, critical thinking, creative problem solvers. My customers are society, industry and alumni. [comment]
	
	> If students are customers, in that we are accountable to them, they need to be reminded that we are like a gym selling membership. Just being a member won't make you fit! [comment]
	
	> I have a problem with a public good that is privately financed with my tuition dollars. The public good ideal is fine when education is publicly financed, but clinging to the status quo by raising tuition is unsustainable. [comment]
	
	> I always tell my students that "you may be a student-consumer, but in my class you bought an intellectual gym membership. You hired me as your trainer this term. It will be fun and stimulating, but it will be difficult. By taking my class, you implicitly agreed that you need to lose 10 pounds of intellectual flab, gain 5 pounds of connect the dots imagination muscle, and develop greater core strength at logical argumentation. If that's not for you, there are a thousand other classes you can take. Do the work with me during our three hours together per week, and during your personal at-home workouts, during office hours, and you'll be taking full advantage of the gym membership. Gold star. Boo yah! Show up at class and say "hi" to everyone at the gym, glance at the equipment (the assigned texts), and b.s. your way through the exercises (quizzes and papers) and that colossal waste of money and resources is on you." None of this solves the much bigger systemic issues, of course. Just a finger in the dam and an attempt to make the classroom an important face-to-face experience with these young men and women. [comment] 
	
	There is a sense of unease in using this consumerist metaphor. Is the student a customer? Or is society the customer? And student the product? What about *education*?
